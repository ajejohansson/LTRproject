# LTRproject
Andreas Johansson LTR project

clusters: WUGs output directories.
Use- and annotation data is in clusters/worddirectory/data/word
Plot html files are in plot_shortcut (also deep in the clusters directory)

reannotations: DURel output files with reannotations. Better viewed comparatively in validation_annotations

validation_annotations: selected previous annotation data (usefiles and annotation files). Annotation files updated with the reannotation

project: notebook with project code. Note: not executable as of submission as the data is not included

additionally not included: WUGs code used for the project. Even the part I wrote myself is heavily tied to the external repository.
